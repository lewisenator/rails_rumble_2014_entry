# My team's [2014 Rails Rumble](https://railsrumble.com/) entry.

### About Rails Rumble (from their website)

The Rails Rumble is a distributed programming competition where hundreds of teams of one to four people, from all over the world, have 48 hours to build an innovative web application, with Ruby on Rails or another Rack-based Ruby web framework.

After the 48 hours are up, everyone picks their favorites and the top ten winners are revealed!

### Our Entry

My team built a Ruby on Rails webapp that allows users to keep track of their movie collection. You can sign-up or login manually or via omniauth. Once logged-in, you can use our search functionality to add movies to your collection and add your personal rating for each movie.
